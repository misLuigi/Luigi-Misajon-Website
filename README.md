# Luigi-Misajon-Website
A personal website for Luigi Misajon.

This website will serve as my portfolio as FED or when applying for Fronend Developer jobs.

I hardcoded this website by following along tutorials on youtube and based on the things I learned from The Odin Projec, FreeCodeCamp, Khan Academy, Harvard's Online Computer Science Course, and utilizing AI power as well.

This project will lead not only to my hardcoded but also to the website I created using website builder and hopefully this time I now have enough knowlede to host wesite online not only on GitHub but also to other hosting provider.

By this time I hope I have my own personal Domain Name.
